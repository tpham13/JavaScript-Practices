SLIDING WINDOW

This pattern involves creating a WINDOW which can either be an array 
or number from one position to another. 

Depeending on a certain condition, the windown either increases or closes(and a new 
window is created) 

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
