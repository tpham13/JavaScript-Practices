WHAT DO DATA STRUCTURE DO? 
* Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them, 
and the functions or operations(adding, removing, etc.) that can be applied to the data. 

* Different data structures excelt at different things 

THERE IS NO 'BEST' DATA STRUCTURE. They all do different things.
